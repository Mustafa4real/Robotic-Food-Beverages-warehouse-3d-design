# Robotic-Food-Beverages-warehouse-3d-design
In this project I did a 3d Design for a fully automated Food &amp; Beverages Warehouse.

The main idea would be robotic arms with prismatic joints to push the products to fall into the roller conveyor. The products would then roll to the box of the customer. The box would then move along the conveyor belt, and the box behind it would take its place.

This project was designed using Tinkercad.
